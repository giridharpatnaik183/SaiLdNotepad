----------==========OSI MODEL==========----------

Application layer is implemented in software. Example Chrome.
		||
        \/
Presentation layer gets the data from Application layer, and convers the information/message into 
machine understandable binarly format, this is known as translation.
Before the data is transferred it goes under Encoding, Encryption, changing the data so that it's readable only
to the person that was sent to. It also provides Abstraction.
Data is also compressed.
		||
		\/
Session layer helps in setting up and managing the connections and it enables sending and receiving the data followed by 
termination of the connected sessions. Authentication and Authorization takes place.
		||
		\/
Transport Layer has its own protocol on how to tranport data like UDP and TCP.
Data received from session layers is divided into small data units known as segments.
every segment will contain the source and the destination's port number and a sequence number.
port number : The data will be received to the correct application.
sequence number : It basically helps to reassamble the segments in the correct order as data is transferred in chunks and 
it has a sequence number.
flow control:Transport layer controls the amount of data that is being transferred.
It also works as error control.
It adds something known as checksum to every data segment, In that way we can figure out the data that was received by your 
friend is good or not.
Connection Oriented transmission (TCP), In TCP 100% data is transferred and you will get the acknowledgement from ur friend
like he has received the data, Example:- Email, FTP 
Connection less oriented transmission (UDP), UDP is faster as it doesn't provide any feedback if data is lost or not.
some data gets lost in udp like gaming and vdeo conferencing.
		||
		\/
Network Layer works for the transmission of received data segments from one computer to another that is located in another
network. IP addressing done in network layer is known as Logical addressing. Every computer has its own ip address.
Network layer assigns sender's and receiver's Ip address to every segment and it form IP packet, so that every packet can reach
its correct destination.and also it form routing i.e moving one data packet from source to destination based on ip address..
It will perform some logical addressing and transfers the data.
		||
		\/
Datalink Layer allows you to directly communicate with the computers and hosts.
Datalink layer will receive the data packet from the Network layer and this data packer contains the IP addresses of 
both the sender and the receiver
A packet conatins ip address of sender, receiver and subnet mask.
To which application does the data needs to be sent which is known as Physical addressing and is done at data link layer.
physical address or also called as mac address. mac addresses of sender and receiver are assigned to the data packet to
form a frame. frame is basically a data unit of the data link layer.
Mac address is a 12 digit alpha numeric number of the network interface of your computer.
Every application/device has a different mac address.
		||
		\/
Physical layer basically contains hardware like wires..It transmits the bits from electrical signals incase of wires,
light incase of optical fibre cable or radio signal incase of wifi..
		
----------=========Another model TCP/IP Model=========----------
It is basically known as Internet Protocol suite developed by ARPA.
similar to the OSI model but the layer are reduced from 7 to 5.
Application layer -> (Application,presentation and session copressed to a single layer)
Transport layer
Network layer
Datalink layer
Physical layer
This Model is practically used whereas the OSI model is concept based.

In details of Each layer
Application Layer
This is the layer users interact with. It consists of various applications like web browsers, whatsapp etc..On your devices
Protocols 
1. Client server architecture
Ping time:It measures the roundtrip time from the message sent from the origin host to the desination of the computer and they 
are echoed back.
Can ping time be redused ?
No, because we are getting the best possible ping time available as the message are travelling at the speed of light through optical 
cables and wires.

2. P2P (Peer to Peer)
computers interconnected like a star which is decentralized.
and each system here can be called as both client and server.

Networking Devices that we use
===============================
1. Repeater – A repeater operates at the physical layer. Its job is to regenerate the signal over the same network before
the signal becomes too weak or corrupted so as to extend the length to which the signal can be transmitted over the same 
network. An important point to be noted about repeaters is that they do not amplify the signal. When the signal becomes weak,
they copy the signal bit by bit and regenerate it at the original strength. It is a 2 port device.

2. Hub – A hub is basically a multiport repeater. A hub connects multiple wires coming from different branches, 
for example, the connector in star topology which connects different stations. Hubs cannot filter data, so data packets
are sent to all connected devices. In other words, collision domain of all hosts connected through Hub remains one. Also, 
they do not have the intelligence to find out best path for data packets which leads to inefficiencies and wastage.

Types of Hub

Active Hub:- These are the hubs which have their own power supply and can clean, boost, and relay the signal along with the 
network. It serves both as a repeater as well as wiring centre. These are used to extend the maximum distance between nodes.

Passive Hub :- These are the hubs which collect wiring from nodes and power supply from active hub. These hubs relay signals 
onto the network without cleaning and boosting them and can’t be used to extend the distance between nodes.

Intelligent Hub :- It work like active hubs and include remote management capabilities. They also provide flexible data rates 
to network devices. It also enables an administrator to monitor the traffic passing through the hub and to configure each port 
in the hub.

3. Bridge – A bridge operates at data link layer. A bridge is a repeater, with add on the functionality of filtering content 
by reading the MAC addresses of source and destination. It is also used for interconnecting two LANs working on the same 
protocol. It has a single input and single output port, thus making it a 2 port device.

Types of Bridges

Transparent Bridges:- These are the bridge in which the stations are completely unaware of the bridge’s existence i.e. whether
or not a bridge is added or deleted from the network, reconfiguration of the stations is unnecessary. These bridges make use 
of two processes i.e. bridge forwarding and bridge learning.

Source Routing Bridges:- In these bridges, routing operation is performed by source station and the frame specifies which 
route to follow. The host can discover frame by sending a special frame called discovery frame, which spreads through the 
entire network using all possible paths to destination.

4. Switch – A switch is a multiport bridge with a buffer and a design that can boost its efficiency(a large number of ports 
imply less traffic) and performance. A switch is a data link layer device. The switch can perform error checking before 
forwarding data, that makes it very efficient as it does not forward packets that have errors and forward good packets 
selectively to correct port only. In other words, switch divides collision domain of hosts, but broadcast domain remains same.

5. Routers – A router is a device like a switch that routes data packets based on their IP addresses. Router is mainly a 
Network Layer device. Routers normally connect LANs and WANs together and have a dynamically updating routing table based on 
which they make decisions on routing the data packets. Router divide broadcast domains of hosts connected through

6. Gateway – A gateway, as the name suggests, is a passage to connect two networks that may work upon different networking 
models. They work as messenger agents that take data from one system, interpret it, and transfer it to another system. Gateways
are also called protocol converters and can operate at any network layer. Gateways are generally more complex than switches or 
routers. A gateway is also called a protocol converter. 

7. Brouter – It is also known as the bridging router is a device that combines features of both bridge and router. It can work 
either at the data link layer or a network layer. Working as a router, it is capable of routing packets across networks and 
working as the bridge, it is capable of filtering local area network traffic. 

8. NIC – NIC or network interface card is a network adapter that is used to connect the computer to the network. It is 
installed in the computer to establish a LAN.  It has a unique id that is written on the chip, and it has a connector to 
connect the cable to it. The cable acts as an interface between the computer and the router or modem. NIC card is a layer 2 
device which means that it works on both the physical and data link layers of the network model. 

Protocols
=========
web protocols:
--------------
TCP/IP:
->http:data is transferred like webpages html like that..
->dhcp: allocates the ip to devies connected to your network
->ftp:to send the files
->smtp:to send the emails
->pop3 & imac: to receive the emails
-> SSH: To connect to other computers
-> VNC: virtual networl conrolling for graphical control
-> Telnet:(port 23) to connect to a remote host or device using a telnet client.
-> UDP: connectionless session, data might be lost in this during the lifetime of the session.

Socket: It is the Interface between the process and the internet.
Ports: Emphemral ports -> if several instances are open on a chrome.
http:(Application layer) It's a stateless protocol
tcp:(Transport layer) makes sure that all the data is received.
Https methods: 
1.GET
2.POST
3.PUT
4.DELETE

Whenever you send a request you need to know whether the rquest was sent or failed, for that there are status codes
200 means request was sucessful
404 means not found
400 means bad request
500 means there was some internal server error

Status category
---------------
1XX range -> Informational Category
2XX range -> sucess codes
3XX range -> redirectional purposes
4XX range -> client error
5XX range -> server error

Cookies: It is a unique string, It is stored in the client's browser.
when you visit the browser for the first time it will set a cookie.


Google it :
How do i disable 3rd party cookies, what measures can we take.
how do companies manage cookies, what do they use for

How email works ?
SMTO: SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL
POP3: POST OFFICE PROTOCOL
SMTP : To send the messages     }\ _ _These are application layer protocols
POP3 : To receive the messages	}/

How is the data transported, which transport layer protocol do we use ?
TCP because we want entire data to be sent, which UDP can't do.

IMAP: Internet message access protocol, It allows to view emails on multiple devices.

-------------------
when we type google.com how does it know where to fetch it ? here comes DNS, it uses DNS to find ip address of google server
what dns does is it take the url example google.com and then converts it to ip address after that it will connect to the server.
DNS : Domain name system, it is a directory service /database.
Domain names are mapped with the ip addresses


mail.google.com
where 
mail:sub domain
google:second-level domain
com:top level domain

Root DNS servers: 1st point of contact when you write a domain name
they have top level domains for example .io,.com,.org
they have second level domain for example student.io,classroom.org,google.com


Imp Note: we cannoy buy a domain we can just rent it.
Example: we rent the domain from Godaddy.com and it rents from ICANN

Transport layer: Transports the data from the network to the Application.
Network layer: Transfers the data from one network to another network.
