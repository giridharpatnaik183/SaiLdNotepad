Theorotical notes on DevOps

Brief explaination of interconnection of all the concepts in devops 
like cloud computing, linux, git, github, jenkins, nginx, docker ansible terraform and kubernetes

Cloud Computing: Think of cloud computing as renting a computer or storage space over the internet instead of owning 
and maintaining physical hardware. It allows you to access resources, like servers and databases, from anywhere. 

SaaS (Software as a Service): Imagine you want to use a software application, like a word processor or email service, 
but you don't want to install or manage it yourself. SaaS is like renting the software over the internet. 
You access the software through a web browser, and the provider takes care of all the behind-the-scenes work, 
such as hosting, maintenance, and updates. You can simply use the software without worrying about the technical details.

PaaS (Platform as a Service): Now, let's say you want to develop and deploy your own application or website. 
PaaS provides you with a platform or environment to build and run your applications without worrying about the underlying 
infrastructure. It's like renting a fully equipped workshop to build something. The PaaS provider takes care of the servers, 
operating systems, and other infrastructure components, while you focus on writing and deploying your application code.

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Imagine you need complete control over the infrastructure, similar to having 
your own data center. IaaS provides you with virtualized infrastructure resources over the internet. It's like 
renting a blank canvas on which you can build your own IT infrastructure. You have control over the servers, storage, 
networking, and operating systems, but you're responsible for managing and maintaining them.

To summarize, 
SaaS is about using software applications without the hassle of installation and maintenance. 
PaaS is a platform for building and deploying your own applications, while the provider manages the underlying infrastructure. 
IaaS gives you more control, allowing you to create and manage your own virtualized infrastructure in the cloud.

Multi-tenancy
Just like the apartments in a building, each tenant in the cloud has their own separate space, which is isolated and 
independent from others. They have their own virtual environment where they can run their applications and store their data.

Linux: Linux is an operating system, like Windows or macOS, but it's known for being open-source and highly customizable.
Many servers and cloud platforms use Linux because it's reliable, secure, and flexible.

Git: Git is a version control system that helps developers manage and track changes in their code. 
It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously, merge their changes, 
and roll back to previous versions if needed.

GitHub: GitHub is a popular platform built on top of Git. It provides a web-based interface to store, 
share, and collaborate on Git repositories. It's like a social network for developers, 
allowing them to host their code, contribute to other projects, and manage issues and discussions.

Jenkins: Jenkins is a tool used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). 
It automates the building, testing, and deployment of software. Jenkins connects to Git repositories, 
pulls the code, runs tests, and deploys the application, making it easier to release new features and updates.

Nginx: Nginx is a web server that handles incoming network requests and serves web pages or content.
It's known for its speed, scalability, and ability to handle high traffic. Nginx can also act as a reverse proxy,
load balancer, or cache server, improving the performance of web applications.

Docker: Docker is a platform for containerization. Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that package
applications and their dependencies. Docker allows developers to build, ship, and run applications consistently 
across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

Docker Hub: Docker Hub is a registry service on the cloud that allows you to download Docker images that are built
by other communities. You can also upload your own Docker built images to Docker hub.

Ansible: Ansible is an automation tool that simplifies the management and configuration of servers and infrastructure.
It uses a simple language to define tasks and playbooks, allowing administrators to automate repetitive tasks and ensure
consistent configurations across systems.

Terraform: Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that helps provision and manage cloud resources.
It allows you to define your infrastructure in declarative code, specifying the desired state of your infrastructure.
Terraform then applies those changes, creating or modifying resources as necessary.

Kubernetes: Kubernetes (often referred to as K8s) is an orchestration platform for containerized applications.
It helps manage, scale, and deploy containers across a cluster of machines. Kubernetes provides features like load balancing,
automatic scaling, and self-healing, making it easier to run and manage applications in production environments.

In summary, DevOps is a set of practices and tools that aim to improve collaboration, automate processes, and ensure faster
and more reliable software development and deployment. Cloud computing provides the infrastructure, Linux powers the servers,
Git and GitHub enable version control and collaboration, Jenkins automates the development process, 
Nginx handles web server duties, Docker facilitates containerization, Ansible automates infrastructure management, 
Terraform provisions cloud resources, and Kubernetes orchestrates containerized applications. 
Together, these concepts and tools form an interconnected ecosystem that enables efficient and scalable software development 
and deployment.


Difference between terraform and ansible

Terraform is a tool for creating and managing infrastructure, like virtual machines and storage, mainly in cloud environments. 
It uses a declarative approach, where you define the desired state of your infrastructure, 
and Terraform takes care of making it happen.

Ansible is a tool for automating tasks on various systems, like servers, networks, and desktops. 
It uses a procedural approach, where you define a series of steps (called playbooks) to be executed in order.

In summary, Terraform is for infrastructure provisioning, while Ansible is for general-purpose automation 
and configuration management across different systems.
